# About project
This is my first bigger project built with React.
I made this project while taking the [Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course on udemy. As the name of the project says it is a bug tracker app, but it can be also used as a To-Do list app.
